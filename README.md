# Introduction
Hey ðŸ‘‹! These are my SH (Bash) scripts! Scroll down below to see how to install them if you desire to!

# Installation

* Open the terminal.
  
* Ensure you have ```git``` installed.
  
* Enter: ```git clone https://github.com/Water607965/SH-Bash-Scripts-```.

* Enter: ```chmod chmod +x Waterlord.sh```

* Enter: ```./Waterlord.sh```. Easter egg: if you insert something after the ".sh" portion, you'll unlock an easter egg in the script! Can be anything you'd like.

* Have fun with the script!

# Considerations

* This was created using the nano tool in the terminal, different Mac's, and primarily Visual Studio Code.

* This was created on a Mac.

* System Requirements: Linux & MacOS. You can do Windows if you utilize some terminal tools that allow you to, or create a Linux virtual machine (VM).

# Conclusion

And yea! That's it! Otherwise, have a great rest of your day!
